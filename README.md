## How to Run Locally

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` directly in any modern web browser. No build steps, frameworks, or npm installations are required.

## How to Add or Edit Projects

Projects are dynamically rendered using JavaScript to make it easy to update them without modifying the HTML structure.

1. Open `js/script.js`.
2. Locate the `projects` array at the top of the file.
3. Add a new object or edit an existing one following this structure:
   ```javascript
   {
       title: "Project Name",
       description: "A short description of what the project does.",
       tags: ["React", "Node.js", "MongoDB"],
       codeLink: "https://github.com/aditya00801/project-repo",
       liveLink: "https://project-url.com" // Leave empty ("") if no live link
   }
   ```
4. Save the file and refresh your browser.
